      				<h2>hey, we’re Cartems!</h2>
					<p>We’re stoked to be here! I started this company with a good friend of mine, and with the help of a few others along the way. Cartems was literally born out of a dream I had 10 years ago. I went to bed one night and woke up with a vision of opening an amazing donut shop, even going so far as foreseeing its name– ‘Cartems’. It doesn’t really mean anything but it means a whole lot to our small team! We’ve grown and learned a lot along the way, and have realized our business is about three key things: smiles, conversation, and donuts. If we can make people smile and talk about our donuts, then that’s a win, simple and plain.<p>

					<h2>our donuts</h2>
					<p>Cartems is all about quality ingredients, creative flavours, and making people smile, one donut at a time. We’ve got the tastiest donuts around, and we want to share them with you!
					Cartems donuts are handmade by skilled pastry chefs and are a fresher, healthier alternative to traditional fast-food donuts. We even offer vegan and gluten-free donuts, as well as baked donuts to give you a lighter alternative to the traditional fried donut (and for the record, we even incorporate coconut oil in the frying of our donuts!).<p>
					
					<h2>sourcing locally</h2>
					<p>Our ingredients are fresh, and our donuts are never ever frozen. Our ingredients are sourced from as close to home as possible, and organic wherever we can. Flour comes from Anita’s Organic Mill (Chilliwack), our eggs are from Rabbit River Farms (Richmond), butter comes from Golden Ears Cheeseworks (Maple Ridge) when available, our milk is from Birchwood Dairy (Abbotsford) and Avalon Dairy (Burnaby), and our spices come from Gathering Place Trading Company on Cortes Island.
					Local ingredients – ethically sourced and sustainable – mean a higher quality donut you can feel better about eating, giving you more reasons to smile.
					Our goal is simply to make the best donuts possible. Sure, they take us a little longer to make, and the ingredients may cost a bit more, but we hope you’ll agree that it’s worth it. We’d love to hear your feedback, let us know what you think on twitter @cartemsdonuts.<p>
