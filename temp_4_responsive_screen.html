        <h2>hey, we’re Cartems!</h2>
          <p>We’re stoked to be here! I started this company with a good friend of mine, and with the help of a few others along the way. Cartems was literally born out of a dream I had 10 years ago. I went to bed one night and woke up with a vision of opening an amazing donut shop, even going so far as foreseeing its name– ‘Cartems’. It doesn’t really mean anything but it means a whole lot to our small team! We’ve grown and learned a lot along the way, and have realized our business is about three key things: smiles, conversation, and donuts. If we can make people smile and talk about our donuts, then that’s a win, simple and plain.<p>
