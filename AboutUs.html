      <h2>hey, we’re the MuffinTopShop!</h2>
			<p>We’re stoked to be here! We started this company with a good friend of mine, and with the help of a few others along the way. The MuffinTopShop was literally born out of a dream I had 10 years ago. I went to bed one night and woke up with a vision of opening an amazing muffin top shop, even going so far as foreseeing its name– ‘MuffinTopShop’. It really means what it says but it means a whole lot more to our small team! We’ve grown and learned a lot along the way, and have realized our business is about three key things: <a href="Home.html">deals</a>, conversations, and <a href="OurMuffins">muffin tops</a> all provided with a smile. If we can make people smile and talk about our muffin tops, then that’s a win, plain and simple.<p>

			<h2>our muffin tops</h2>
			<p>The MuffinTopShop is all about quality ingredients, creative flavours, and making people smile, one top at a time. We’ve got the <a href="OurMuffins.html">tastiest muffin tops</a> around, and we want to share them with you! The MuffinTopShop are handmade by skilled pastry chefs and are the best part of the muffin, the tops. We even offer gluten-free muffin tops, as well as fruity muffin tops to give you a sweet alternative to the traditional bran and plain muffin tops (and for the record, we even incorporate a secret ingredient).<p>
					
			<h2>sourcing locally</h2>
			<p>Our ingredients are fresh, and our muffin tops are never ever frozen. Our ingredients are sourced from as close to home as possible, and organic wherever we can. Flour comes from Anita’s Organic Mill (Chilliwack), our eggs are from Rabbit River Farms (Richmond), butter comes from Golden Ears Cheeseworks (Maple Ridge) when available, our milk is from Birchwood Dairy (Abbotsford) and Avalon Dairy (Burnaby), and our spices come from Gathering Place Trading Company on Cortes Island.Local ingredients – ethically sourced and sustainable – mean a higher quality donut you can feel better about eating, giving you more reasons to smile.Our goal is simply to make the best muffin tops possible. Sure, they take us a little longer to make, and the ingredients may cost a bit more, but we hope you’ll agree that it’s worth it. We’d love to hear your feedback, let us know what you think by leaving a comment on our <a href= "Contact.html">contact </a> page. <p>
